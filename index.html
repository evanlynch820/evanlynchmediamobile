                    Note: This website is still under construction. I am adding mobile functionality and am currently adding
                    more of my work.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    I am a junior in high school based in Chattanooga with a passion for all things marketing related. I recently
                    obtained a certification in Digital Marketing from Hubspot Academy, and I love working
                    in both sports and childcare. I have been in photography for over 2 years
                    now, and videography for about a year and a half. I currently work as a game-day photographer and
                    videographer for the Chattanooga Lookouts, a Double-A baseball team. In June 2023, I began work as the
                    social media manager for Camp Big Fish, a children's day-camp located mainly in East Tennessee, but
                    expanding towards Middle Tennessee. I also work with Silverdale Baptist Academy to create content for
                    the football and boys basketball teams. Services that I offer include digital marketing, photography,
                    videography, social media management, and graphic design. In the future I will likely also offer web
                    development.
